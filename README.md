## General principles

### Project

### File format

 * Files must be stored as ASCII text.
 * Files must use UTF-8 character encoding
 * Line termination follows the Unix text file convention. Lines must end with a single linefeed ({{{LF}}}) character. Linefeed characters are represented as ordinal {{{10}}}, or hexadecimal {{{0x0A}}}. Do not use carriage returns ({{{CR}}}) as it’s the convention in Apple OS’s ({{{0x0D}}}) or the carriage return/linefeed combination ({{{CRLF}}}) as it’s the default setting for the Windows OS ({{{0x0D}}}, {{{0x0A}}}).

### Indenting and line length

 * Tabs are superior, so use tabs to indent, not spaces. Make sure that
   the tab-stops are set to 4 spaces in length.
 * There is no set limit for line length. Use your own judgement based on the nature of the line and readability.

 * use an .editorconfig file
 * tabs are superior
 * new line on EOF
